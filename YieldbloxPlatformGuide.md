## Using the Platform - Lending
Lenders provide assets to the lending pool and receive interest in return. Borrowers can [borrow](https://docs.ybx.script3.io/user-docs/lending-borrowing/borrowing) these assets by posting [collateral](https://docs.ybx.script3.io/user-docs/lending-borrowing/borrowing#what-is-collateral) and paying interest at loan repayment.

Once you're logged into YieldBlox Dashboard, you can choose from any of the listed assets to lend and borrow in the YieldBlox protocol.
