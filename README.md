## AMMs and Liquidity Pools
AMMs are **highly complex** investment vehicles and it's best to learn and understand them before getting started. In the [General Resources](https://github.com/theboycoder/Yieldblox-Community-Guide-/blob/main/README.md#videos-talks-and-ama) section there are tools and resources to learn more about AMMs and Liquidity Pools. In the Stellar Ecosystem users can now access products and interfaces created by ecosystem developers to deposit into liquidity pools. This includes the XLM/YBX pair which is one of the more popular pairs in the stellar liqudity pools. The pair is also currently(*subject to change*) voted in by the community for the [AQUA](https://aqua.network/) liquidity rewards program, which provides hourly AQUA rewards to those providing liquidity to this pair along with trading fees from the AMM shares.
